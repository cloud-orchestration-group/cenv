Zimagi System Documentation
###########################

Hello!  Welcome to the documentation site for the **Zimagi** project, a secure
and modular open source distributed data management and processing system built
to allow for easy low code development of APIs and functional command
processing engines.

This documentation is currently broken up into two main sections.  The
**Getting Started** section covers general information about the project and
instructions for getting up and running with the Zimagi platform quickly and
easily.  The **Design and Architecture** section provides information on the
code design and archictural concepts as well as general reference information
for understanding the Zimagi system in more detail, so you can customize for
your needs.

If you have ideas, feedback, or issues with this documentation please file an
issue in the `Zimagi project <https://github.com/zimagi/zimagi/issues>`_ and we
will address them as promptly as possible.
