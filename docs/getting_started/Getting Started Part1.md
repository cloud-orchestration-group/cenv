### What is Zimagi Capable Of?

Zimagi is a distributed data processing platform that is capable of orchestrating and managing both business and data processes.

In simple words, Zimagi scales up and processes the data processes periodically and helps you to maintain multiple workflows in an organized fashion.

* **Data Models as Code** - Data Models are the data objects that can be defined as code. This makes it easier to collaborate, maintain and distribute across functional teams members.

* **Build Data Processing Workflows** - Complex Data Workflows known as *Profiles* can be created to orchestrate the data imports and transformations across clusters.

* **Ship Zimagi Projects** - The data models along with settings, specifications and other configurations can be shipped as git version controlled *Modules*.

* **Portability** - Zimagi can be installed anywhere and doesn't require a dedicated server.

* **Data Security** - The platform data, configurations and fields are encrypted. This secures the meta data related to the Zimagi modules.

Zimagi Platform can be utilized from two user perspectives:

- *Zimagi Module Developers* - The Data models and specifications are defined by these developers. The modules developed by these users will be utilized by the Module users.

- *Zimagi Module Users* - The portable modules developed by the Zimagi Module Developers can be cloned onto any machines and zimagi platform can be made up and running by the users.

The advantages of using Zimagi for the data processing workloads are many. It has the capabilities of the open source workflow managers such as airflow, luigi and also additional features to build your next robust data processing workflow.
