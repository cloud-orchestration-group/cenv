What is Zimagi Capable Of?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zimagi is a distributed data processing platform that is capable of
orchestrating and managing both business and data processes.

Zimagi scales up and processes data operations, helping you maintain
multiple workflows in an organized fashion. Zimagi features:

-  **Data Models as Code** - Data Models are data objects that can be
   defined with code. This makes it easier to collaborate, maintain, and
   distribute data across functional team members.
-  **Build Data Processing Workflows** - Complex Data Workflows known as
   *Profiles* can be created to orchestrate data imports and
   transformations across clusters.
-  **Ship Zimagi Projects** - The Data Models along with settings,
   specifications, and other configurations, can be shipped as git
   version controlled repository called a *Module*.
-  **Portability** - Zimagi can be installed anywhere and doesn't
   require a dedicated server.
-  **Data Security** - The platform data, configurations, and fields are
   encrypted. This secures the metadata related to the Zimagi modules.

The Zimagi Platform can be utilized in two different ways, as a
developer and as a user:

-  *Zimagi Module Developers* - The Data models and specifications are
   defined by module developers. Modules created by developers can be
   utilized by the Module users.
-  *Zimagi Module Users* - The portable modules developed by the module
   can be cloned onto any machine, allowing a general user to get a
   Zimagi platform up and running.

There are many advantages of using Zimagi for the data processing
workloads. It has the capabilities of open source workflow managers such
as Airflow or Luigi, but it also has additional features to help you
create your next robust data processing workflow.
