        Default database is SQLite, but PostgreSQL can be started in container

    start:
        overview: |
            Start a containerized PostgreSQL service on host and use for local connections

            When PostgreSQL is not initialized, a simpler SQLite single-file database is used.
            For higher performance, using PostgreSQL is desirable.

    stop:
        overview: |
            Stop containerized PostgreSQL service on host and reset database connection

            Fall back to using simpler SQLite local database
